Why is a stack the right choice for undo/redo?
It is the right choice because it uses the LIFO order, because it lets you undo or redo the most recent action.

Why is a queue better suited for the help desk?
A stack on the other hand uses the FIFO order, so customers get the service in the order they arrive. It also shows you the queue to see who is next.

How do your implementations differ from Pythonâ€™s built-in lists?
Stack and Queue use linked nodes. It makes things faster than a Python list.
